# Stock Forecasting Using Geometric Brownian Motion

## Welcome to the app ðŸ‘‹

This app is an interactive dashboard showcasing stock value predicitons based on a stochastic model, the geometric Brownian motion, modeled by a random walk and developed for assessment on the *Simulation and Stochastic Processes* unit from the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto (Department of Mathematics). **The app is not meant to give financial advice!**

## Install and run the app

Assuming you have Python installed, you'll have to install the required Python packages. Open the terminal in the correct directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you just have to run the following command and the app will run locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
## Online version

There's also an online version of this app available at:
